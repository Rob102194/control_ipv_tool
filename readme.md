Restaurant Inventory Consumption Verifier
This application is designed to help with daily inventory management for restaurants by providing a robust system to verify ingredient consumption against sales data. It tackles the common challenge of reconciling theoretical ingredient usage with actual stock levels in various work areas.

What It Does
Our tool precisely calculates the expected ingredient consumption based on your daily sales figures. It then allows you to compare these theoretical consumption values with your physical final inventory counts in specific work areas (e.g., kitchen, bar, prep stations). This direct comparison instantly highlights any discrepancies, making it easy to spot over-portioning, waste, theft, or data entry errors.

Key Features
Sales-Based Consumption Calculation: Automatically determines how much of each ingredient should have been used based on recipes and sales volumes.

Area-Specific Inventory Verification: Supports tracking and verification of inventory levels across different operational zones of your restaurant.

Discrepancy Identification: Quickly points out variances between calculated consumption and actual end-of-day inventory, enabling prompt investigation.

Improved Accuracy: Enhances the precision of your inventory records, leading to more reliable stock insights.

Data-Driven Insights: Provides the data needed to make informed decisions about purchasing, portion control, and operational efficiency.

Why Use It?
Manual inventory checks are prone to errors and often fail to explain why inventory levels differ from expectations. This application empowers restaurant managers to:

Reduce Waste & Spoilage: By identifying where and why ingredients are being overused or lost.

Control Costs: Gain better control over food costs by minimizing discrepancies and optimizing purchasing.

Enhance Accountability: Provide clear data on inventory performance for each work area.

Streamline Operations: Automate complex calculations, freeing up valuable staff time.
